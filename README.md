1. STRICTURES ON TENDER-ACTS.The fatal error, that the credit and currency of the Continental money could be kept up and ſupported by acts of con••••ſion, entered ſo deep into the mind of Congreſs and of all departments of adminiſtration thro' the States, that no conſiderations of juſtice, religion, or policy, or even experience of its utter inefficacy, could eradicate it; it ſeemed to be a kind of obſtinate delirium, totally deaf to every argument drawn from juſtice and right, from its natural tendency and miſchief, from common ſenſe, and even common ſafety.Congreſs began, as early as Jan. 11, 1776, to hold up and recommend this maxim of maniaſm, when Continental money was but 5 months old (for its actual circulation commenced the beginning of Auguſt 1775, tho' the bills were dated May 10, preceding, that being the firſt day of that ſeſſion of Congreſs) Congreſs then reſolved, that "whoever ſhould refuſe to receive in payment, Continental bills, &c. ſhould be deemed and treated as an enemy of his country, and be precluded from all trade and intercourſe with the inhabitants," &c. i. e. ſhould be outl•wed; which is the ſevereſt penalty (except of life and limb) known in our laws.This ruinous principle was continued in practice for five ſucceſſive years, and appeared in all ſhapes and forms, i. e. in tender-acts, in limitations of prices, in awful and threatening declarations, in penal laws with dreadful and ruinous puniſhments, and in every other way that could be deviſed, and all executed with a relentleſs ſeverity, by the higheſt authorities then in being, viz. by Congreſs, by Aſſemblies and Conventions of the States, by committees of inſpection (whoſe powers in thoſe days were nearly ſovereign) and even by military force; and tho' men of all deſcriptions ſtood trembling before this monſter of force, without daring to lift a hand againſt it, during all this period, yet its unreſtrained energy ever proved ineffectual to its purpoſes, but in every inſtance increaſed the evils it was deſigned to remedy, and deſtroyed the benefits it was intended to promote; at beſt its utmoſt effect was like that of water ſprinkled on a blackſmith's forge, which indeed deadens the flame for a moment, but never fails to increaſe the •eat and force of the internal fire. Many thouſand families of full and eaſy fortune were ruined by theſe fatal meaſures, and lie in ruins to this day, without the leaſt benefit to the country, or to the great and noble cauſe in which we were then engaged.I do not mention th•ſe things from any pleaſure I have in opening the wounds of my country, or expoſing its errors, but with a hope that our fatal miſtakes may be a caution and ••arning to future financiers, who may live and act in any country which may happen to be in circumſtances ſimilar to ours at that time.N. B. The act of Nov. 29, 1780, herein referred to, was paſſed into a law, Dec. 19, 178•.

1. AN ESSAY OR Humble Attempt to examine and ſtate the TRUE INTEREST Of PENNSYLVANIA with Reſpect to the Paper Currency.

1. AN ESSAY ON The ECONOMY, POLICY, and RESOURCES of the THIRTEEN STATES, AND The MEANS of their PRESERVATION.

1. A DISSERTATION ON THE Nature, Authority, and Uſes of the Office of a FINANCIER-GENERAL, OR SUPERINTENDANT of the FINANCES.

1. REMARKS ON THE RESOLUTION OF COUNCIL, Of the 2d of May, 1781, for raiſing the Exchange to 17• Continental dollars for 1 hard. Humbly offered to the Public.

1. STRICTURES ON A Publication in the FREEMAN's JOURNAL of May 16, 1781, ſigned TIMOLEON.TIMOLEON was an angry writer, who appeared in the Freeman's Journal of May 16, 1781▪ in vindication of the reſolve of Council on which the foregoing Remarks (of the Citizen) were made.I ever ſuppoſed the author to be Preſident Reed; but as he choſe to ſhroud himſelf in darkneſs, and the printer would not give up his name, I did not think myſelf under any obligation to addreſs him in a ſtyle or manner due to the firſt officer of the State; but, with the greateſt freedom, treated the performance according to the merit of it.But whoever was the author, the arguments (ſuch as they were) are conſidered in theſe Strictures; but where the author was mean enough to leave the merits of the matter, and deſcend to low ſcurrility and perſonal abuſe, I paſſed over it, as it was of no conſequence to the public; and only remarked on one or two ſcandalous perſonal imputations, which I never before heard of from any body but himſelf.In fine, the fatal importance of the faces, not any perſonal animoſity, was at that time my ſole motive for making my Remarks and Strictures, and is now the ſame for re-publiſhing them.

1. STRICTURES ON Two Publications in the FREEMAN's JOURNAL of May 30, 1781, ſigned PHOCION, AND IMPARTIAL.PHOCION appeared in the Freeman's Journal of May, 30, 1781, when, in anſwer to my challenge, he, with great triu••••, produced Robert Morris,eſq. who, he ſays, adviſed publiſhing the exch.〈◊〉 at 75 for 1, in April laſt; which, if true, would have been nothing to the purpoſe.But he appeared again in the Journal of June 6, with a recantation of what he had publiſhed about mr. Morris.—IMPARTIAL appeared in the ſame paper of May 30, and is, I ſuppoſe, the ſame perſon with TIMOLEON and PHOCION, or, which comes to about the ſame thing, ſome heated par••ſ•n of the 〈◊〉He ſet out with blackening the CITIZEN and all the Republican party with ran• or enough, and concludes with a labored panegyric of mr. Reed's government. Any body who wiſhes to ſee any of theſe pieces, may find them in the Freeman's Journal, as above quoted.

1. A DISSERTATION ON THE POLITICAL UNION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE THIRTEEN UNITED STATES OF NORTH-AMERICA, Which is neceſſary to their Preſervation and Happineſs; humbly offered to the Public.Forming a plan of confederation, or a ſyſtem of general government of the United States, engroſſed the attention of Congreſs from the declaration of independence, July 4. 1776, till the ſame was completed by Congreſs, July 9, 1778, and recommended to the ſeveral States for ratification, which finally took place, March 1, 1781; from which time the ſaid confederation was conſidered as the grand conſtitution of the general government, and the whole adminiſtration was conformed to it.And as it had ſtood the teſt of diſcuſſion 〈◊〉 Congreſs for two years, before they completed and adopted it, and in all the States for 〈◊◊〉 more, before it was finally ratified, one would have thought that it 〈◊〉 have been a very finiſhed and perfect plan of government.But on trial of it in practice, it was found to be extremely weak, defective, totally inefficient, and altogether inadequate to its great ends and purpoſes. For,1. It blended the legiſlative and executive powers together in one body.2. This body, viz. Congreſs, conſiſted of but one houſe, without any check upon their reſolutions.3. The powers of Congreſs in very few inſtances were definitive and final; in the moſt important articles of government they could do no more than recommend to the ſeveral States; the conſent of every one of which was neceſſary to give legal ſanction to any act ſo recommended.4. They could aſſ•ſs and levy no taxes.5. They could inſtitute and execute no puniſhments, except in the military department.6. They had no power of deciding or controlling the contentions and diſputes of different States with each other.7. They could not regulate the general trade: or,8. Even make laws to ſecure either public treaties with foreign States, or the perſons of public ambaſſadors, or to puniſh violations or injuries done to either of them.9. They could inſtitute no general judiciary powers.10. They could regulate no public roads, canals, or inland navigation, &c. &c. &c.And what caps all the reſt was, that (whilſt under ſuch an inefficient political conſtitution, the only chance we had of any tolerable adminiſtration lay wholly in the prudence and wiſdom of the men who happened to take the lead in our public councils) it was fatally provided by the abſurd doctrine of rotation, that if any Member of Congreſs by three years' experience and application, had qualified himſelf to manage our public affairs with conſiſtency and fitneſs, that he ſhould be conſtitutionally and abſolutely rendered incapable of ſerving any longer, till by three years' diſcontinuance, he had pretty well loſt the cue or train of the public counſels, and forgot the ideas and plans which made his ſervices uſeful and important; and, in the mean time, his place ſhould be ſupplied by a freſh man, who had the whole matter to learn, and when he had 〈◊〉 it, was to give place to another freſh man; and ſo on to the end of the chapter.The ſenſible mind of the United State•, by long experience of the fatal miſchiefs of anarchy, or (which is about the ſame thing) of this ridiculous, inefficient form of government, began to apprehend that there was ſomething wrong in our policy, which ought to be redreſſed and mended; but nobody undertook to delineate the neceſſary amendments.I was then pretty much at leiſure, and was fully of opinion (tho' the ſentiment at that time would not very well bear) that it would be ten times eaſier to form a new conſtitution than to mend the old one. I therefore ſat myſelf down to ſketch out the leading principles of that political conſtitution, which I thought neceſſary to the preſervation and happineſs of the United States of America, which are compriſed in this Diſſertation.I hope the reader will pleaſe to conſider, that theſe are the original thoughts of a private individual, dictated by the nature of the ſubject only, long before the important theme became the great object of diſcuſſion, in the moſt dignified and important aſſembly, which ever ſat or decided in America.

1. A SIXTH ESSAY ON FREE TRADE and FINANCE. Particularly ſhowing what Supplies of Public Revenue may be drawn from MERCHANDISE, without injuring our Trade, or burdening our People. Humbly offered to the Public.

1. A SEVENTH ESSAY ON FREE TRADE and FINANCE; In which the Expediency of Funding the Public Securities, Striking further Sums of Paper Money, and other important Matters, are conſidered.The funding act of Pennſylvania was printed for public conſideration ſome months before it was enacted into a law (March 16, 1785) during which time this Eſſay was publiſhed: the ſaid act directed, among other things▪1. That one year's intereſt ſhould be paid 〈◊〉 this State on all Continental certificates, which originally iſſued to any citizen or citizens of this State▪ &c. with a proviſo, that that ſpecies of certificates, commonly called final ſettlements, which ſhould be intitled to intereſt, ſhould not have been alienated or transferred, but ſhall remain the property of the original holder, his heirs, &c. (which proviſo, in ••y opinion, ought to have extended to all the other kinds of certificates, as well as to the final ſettlements:) by this proviſo, every poſſeſſor of a final ſettlement, except he was the original holder of it, was excluded from receiving intereſt.But I take it, that the true ſpirit, deſign, and reaſon of this proviſo was, in a conſiderable degree, eluded in the ſubſequent practice; for the ſtatute, among other proofs that the man who claimed intereſt, was really the original holder, preſcribed this one, viz. that ſuch claimant ſhould make oath before a prothonatory, that he was truly the original holder of the certificate, and had not alienated it; and this certificate of the prothonatory of ſuch oath being made, being annexed to the certificate on which intereſt was demanded, by conſtruction of the ſtatute, entitled the poſſeſſor of it to draw intereſt, tho' he was not the original holder; by which means very many certificates were •old with ſuch affidavits annexed, and the poſſeſſor, tho' an alien••, drew the intereſt on them as well as if he had been the original holder.2. A tax was inſtituted for raiſing an annual ſum of 76,945l. 17s. 6d. and,3. An emiſſion of 150,000l. in paper money, 50,000l. of which was reſerved for a loan-office, and the other 100,000l. together with the aforeſaid 〈…〉 6d. were appropriated to the payment of ſaid year's intereſt, and 〈…〉 The year 〈◊〉 intereſt at 6 per cent. paid under this act, amounted to 267,694 dollars, the capital of which, of courſe was 4,461,570 dollars, nearly.This high tax proved a heavy burden upon ſuch of our people as happened to have no certificates on which they could receive intereſt and little benefit even to the moſt of thoſe who had them; for the certificates were monopolized into few hands, and not many of our people drew more intereſt than would pay their taxes.And as theſe heavy ſums were moſtly paid to ſuch holders of certificates, as had never rendered any ſervices to the State, or contributed any ſupplies, or had any kind of merit or earnings, on which they could, with any pretence, found their claim to ſo great a contribution from the public, much uneaſineſs was generated, and our people found that their labor was vain, in as much as the profits of it were drained from them, for purpoſes of no uſe or advantage to them.For it is to be noted here, that altho' intereſt was granted by this act for but one year, yet it was expected to be continued, and really was ſo, for ſeveral years afterwards, by a ſubſequent act (March 1, 1786) tho' under a ſomewhat different form, yet with the ſame burden as before.The paper bills emitted by this act never paſſed as a general currency, but were negotiated in market, like other commodities, at the exchange which they happened to gain, but always in a depreciated ſtate, i. e. at a diſcount from 10 to 30 per cent.In fine, this unhappy meaſure has coſt this State already more than 500,000l. and ſtill we are not clear of it.And, I believe, no man can count up 500d. benefit which the State ever received from it.I clearly foreſaw the miſchiefs of this fatal meaſure, and to obviate and prevent them was the deſign of this Eſſay, and tho' I did not ſucceed, Yet I have real ſatisfaction in reflecting that I exerted my utmoſt abilities, and faithfully performed my duty in the attempt, tho' it proved not ſucceſsful, to avert the calamities of the State of which I am a citizen.

1. A PLEA FOR THE Poor Soldiers: OR, AN ESSAY To demonſtrate that the SOLDIERS and other PUBLIC CREDITORS, who really and actually ſupported the Burden of the late War, HAVE NOT BEEN PAID, OUGHT TO BE PAID, CAN BE PAID, and MUST BE PAID.

1. AN ESSAY ON THE SEAT OF THE Federal Government, AND THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF CONGRESS OVER A Ten Miles Diſtrict; WITH OBSERVATIONS On the Economy and delicate Morals neceſſary to be obſerved in infant States.

1. REMARKS ON THE Addreſs of Sixteen Members OF THE ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS, Dated September 29, 1787. With ſome Strictures on their Objections to the CONSTITUTION recommended by the late Federal Convention.When the New Conſtitution was laid before the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania, in September, 1787, a reſolution paſſed the Houſe (forty-three againſt nineteen) to call a Convention to conſider it, &c. Sixteen of the Diſſentients publiſhed an Addreſs to their Conſtituents, dated September 27, 1787, ſtating their conduct and aſſigning the reaſons of it: but as there was very little in all this affair that reflected much honor on the diſſenting Members or on the State to which they belonged, and nothing that could affect or concern any body out of that State, I have here omitted my remarks on all of it, but their objections to the New Conſtitution itſelf, which being of general conſequence to the States, in as much as that Conſtitution (with a few amendments ſince adopted) is the ſame which now exiſts in full eſtabliſhment thro' the Union, I therefore here inſert, I ſay, their objections and my remarks on them, and leave out all the reſt as matter of 〈◊〉 concern at t•at time, but like to be little intereſting to the public in general at this or any future time.

1. STRICTURES ON THE NET PRODUCE OF THE TAXES OF GREAT-BRITAIN, In the Year 1784, as publiſhed by Order of their Houſe of Commons.

1. AN ESSAY ON TEST-ACTS Impoſed with Penalties.By the act of the Legiſlature of Pennſylvania, June 13, 1777, the following oath was required, viz.I  _____ _____  do ſwear, or affirm, that I renounce and refuſe all allegiance to George III. King of Great-Britain, his heirs, and ſucceſſors; and that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Commonwealth of Pennſylvania, as a free and independent State; and that I will not at any time do, or cauſe to be done, any matter or thing that will be prejudicial or injurious to the freedom and independence thereof, as declared by Congreſs; and alſo that I will diſcover and make known to ſome one juſtice of peace of the ſaid State, all treaſons, or traitorous conſpiracies, which I now know or hereafter ſhall know to be formed againſt this or any of the United States of America.On which I beg leave to remark,I. That a very great number of the principal inhabitants of Pennſylvania, and as reſpectable and well-behaved as any in the State, from ſcruples of conſcience had ever refuſed to take or ſubſcribe any oath or affirmation of allegiance to any government, either Britiſh or American.II. Very many very ſerious and good men, and faſt friends to America and the American cauſe, thought at that time that the Declaration of Independence was premature; and it was a matter of great doubt with all men, whether that independence could be finally ſupported; and, ſhould it fail, many thought,III. That abjuring the Britiſh government would involve them in perjury, or, at leaſt, in a ſhameful and ridiculous duplicity of contact, under the moſt awful and ſolemn criſis of deportment.IV. Many wiſe men had a great attachment to the Britiſh government, under which they were born and educated; and tho' they 〈◊〉 and condemned the demands and conduct of the Britiſh court as much as any man in Congreſs yet did not think that a redreſs of American grievances was 〈◊〉, or that it was the real, true intereſt of America to be disjoined from the Britiſh Empire; at leaſt, they thought the American independence ought to the ſettled, and the war ſhould be ever, and the diſputes between the contending States ſhould be adjuſted, before an oath of allegiance to the one, or abjuration of the other, ſhould be demanded.V. Many good men thought they did not underſtand the nature and eſſential qualities of treaſons or treaſonable conſpiracies, well enough to be ſafe in ſwearing to give information of all ſuch as came within their knowledge; or they might know ſuch, but not be able to make proof of them, and, of courſe, their information would expoſe them not only to the reſentment, but to real actions of defamation.I do not pretend to determine whether any or all of the above objections againſt taking ſaid oath, were good and proper or not; but they had ſuch weight with great numbers, that near half of our moſt ſerious people refuſed taking the oath.Yet, I conceive, all men will allow that Pennſylvania was as true to the American cauſe, and ſupported it with as much effort, zeal, and unanimity as any State in the Union; and the •ew 〈◊〉 we had, who retained any attachment to the Britiſh government, were moſt effectually converted by the ſamples of Britiſh faith, honor, and 〈◊〉 exhibited by General Howe, whilſt he commanded the Britiſh army in Philadelphia and its neighbourhood.But be all this as it may, the extraordinary penalties with which the oath was enforced, were, in my opinion, equally uſeleſs, abſurd, and •ever•• ſome of which were as follows, viz.That every perſon above the age of eighteen years, refuſing or neglecting to take and ſubſcribe the ſaid oath or affirmation, ſhall, during the time of ſuch neglect or refuſal, be incapable of holding any office or place of truſt in this State, ſerving on juries, ſuing for any debts, electing or being elected, buying, ſelling, or transferring any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, and ſhall be diſarmed, &c.—Travelling out of the city or county where he uſually reſides, without a certificate of his having taken the oath or affirmation, may be committed to the common gaol to remain without bail or mainpriſe.Shall be diſabled to ſue or uſe any action, bill, plaint, or information in courſe of l•w, or to proſecute any ſuit in equity or otherwiſe howſoever, or to be guardian of the perſon or eſtate of any child, or to to be executor or adminiſtrator of any perſon• ſhall be incapable of any legacy or deed of gi••• or to make any will or teſtament; and ſhall be compelled to pay double taxes, &c.All non-juring truſtees, provoſts, rectors, profeſſors, maſters and tutors of any college or academy, and all ſchoolmaſters and uſ••••s merchants and traders, ſergeants and counſellors at law, barriſters, advocates atto•nies, ſolicitors, proctors, clerks or notaries, apothecaries, druggiſts, and every perſon practiſing phyſic, are diſabled in law to uſe any of thoſe employments, and liable to be fined 500l. for practiſing in any of them.Two juſtices may ſummon any non-juring perſon before them, and, on refuſal to take the ſaid oath or affirmation, commit him to the common gaol or houſe of correction for three months, unleſs he pay any ſum, with coſts, under 10l. which they may require, and alſo become bound with ſufficient ſureties to appear at the ne•t court of general quarter ſeſſions of the peace; where, if he refuſes to take the oath or affirmation, he ſhall, under the direction of the court, depart the State in thirty days, and forfeit his goods and chattels to the State, and his lands and tenements to the perſons who would by law be entitled to inherit the ſame, in caſe ſuch offender was dead inteſtate, &c. &c.N. B. By act of Aſſembly of March 29, 1787 the above-mentioned oath, with all the ſhocking penalties of it, was repealed, after it had done infinite miſchief in the State, and had kept the party that made it, in the ſaddle about ten years (which, by the way, I conceive, was the principal deſign and uſe of it) and there was ſubſtituted in the ſtead of it, a very ſimple oath of allegiance, without any of the exceptionable clauſes of the former, by which the rights of our citizens are reſtored, and a happy peace and general ſatisfaction of our people have ſucceeded.
